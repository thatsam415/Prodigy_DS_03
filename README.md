# Decision Tree Classifier ‚Äì Bank Marketing

A machine learning project that builds a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and behavioral data. The model uses the **Bank Marketing dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, visualization, and Decision Tree modeling techniques to classify client subscription behavior in a marketing campaign run by a Portuguese bank.

## üìÅ Dataset Description

- **Source**: [UCI Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)
- **Records**: 41,188 client records
- **Goal**: Predict the binary target variable `y` ‚Äì whether a client subscribes to a term deposit

## üîç Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Missing values handled
- Duplicate entries removed
- Label encoding for categorical features
- Outlier treatment (IQR method)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate and Bivariate visualizations
- Categorical and numerical insights
- Correlation heatmap

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering
- Dropped highly correlated features: `emp.var.rate`, `euribor3m`, `nr.employed`

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building
- Split into training and test sets
- Built Decision Tree classifiers using:
  - `Gini` index
  - `Entropy` criterion

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation
- Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report
- Visual representation of the decision tree

## üìà Results

| Criterion | Training Accuracy | Testing Accuracy |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Gini      | ~93.6%            | ~93.3%           |
| Entropy   | ~93.6%            | ~93.2%           |

## üßæ Conclusion

- Both Gini and Entropy performed well.
- Gini showed slightly better performance in identifying true positives.
- Visual tree representation aids business understanding and interpretability.
